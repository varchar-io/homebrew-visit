# homebrew-visit
publish visit to homebrew

## guideline
I followed [this](https://betterprogramming.pub/a-step-by-step-guide-to-create-homebrew-taps-from-github-repos-f33d3755ba74) for step by step to set it up.

Note that, you have to remvoe the creation file locally otherwise install may fail
`rm /opt/homebrew/Library/Taps/homebrew/homebrew-core/Formula/visit.rb`

## install
> brew tap varchar-io/visit && brew install visit

## use
In a terminal, just type visit
> visit
